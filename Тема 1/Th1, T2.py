# Create a python program named “task2”, and use the built-in function `print` in it several times. Try to pass “sep”, “end” params and pass several parameters separated by commas. 

# Also, provide a comment text above each print statement, mentioned above, with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.

# (Ex.
# ‘hello world’
# print(“hello world”)
# )

# My solution

#Hello world

print('Hello', 'world', sep=' ')

#Helloworld!

print('Helloworld', end='!')

#Hello world!

print('Hello', 'world', sep=' ', end='!')
