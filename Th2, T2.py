# Manipulate strings.

# Save your first and last name as separate variables, then use string concatenation to add them together with a white space in between and print a greeting.

# My solution 

#create variables
name = 'Vlad'; surname = ' Kuzniak'

#create new variable with concatination both last
ns = name + surname

#greeting
print('Good morning' + ', ' + ns, end='!')
